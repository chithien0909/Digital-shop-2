                <p>The old sales saying is that while facts tell, stories sell.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, it’s not quite that simple in reality. Especially with more technical products or spaces where people need to know exactly what they’re getting.</p>
                <p>So you have to walk a tightrope when it comes to marketing features vs benefits. You need to highlight specific features so that savvy buyers can easily figure out how you compare, while at the same time not alienating mainstream buyers who might not care about the intricacies of what you sell.</p>
                <p>Go too far one way or the other and you run into problems. But it can also cause a host of other issues, like forcing you to compete on price because the marketing features you’re boasting don’t resonate with the benefits your customers might see.</p>

                <p>Here’s why this often happens, and how to avoid it once and for all by <b>transforming your features into benefits</b> and outcomes that customers will happily pay more for.</p>

                    Does Your Company Compete on Price?
                </h3>
                <p>Remember how buying web hosting used to be a decade ago?</p>
                <img src="./images/img_10.jpg" alt="image">
                <p>The problem with a race to the bottom and competing solely on features and price is two-fold.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Cost-conscious consumers are loyal to price, not brands. That’s why hotels on Expedia lower the rack rate as much as possible, to appear cheap, only to gouge customers when they check-in with a $50 daily resort fee. The issue is that it trains customers to seek out the lowest listed price in their star rating preference, as opposed to looking for your brand by name or reputation.</li>
                    <li>Competing on price also erodes margins, which actually backfires on the company over time because it reduces profits they can reinvest in making the product quality better. That means over the long haul, your products or services will get worse and worse, sabotaging the customer retention and true word-of-mouth recommendations to grow a big, long-lasting business.</li>
